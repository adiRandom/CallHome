# CallHome

You live a busy life. It's understandable that you forget to call your mom from time to time, or to keep in touch with your old friend that you want to keep a connection with. With the current tech, forgetting is a thing of the past.

Choose from your contact list all the people you want to keep in touch with, then select how often you wish to call them.  Unlike a recurring reminder, CallHome won't just send you one notification that ends up at the bottom of your notification list. That accomplishes nothing. Instead, CallHome watches your call history, and when the time coms to make that weekly call to your family, you will receive a notification until you finally get to it. 

Never forget to Call Home again.
